            <div className='subtitle-montserrat'>Information from Children</div>
            <div className='context-montserrat'>While Balikaral is intended for users age 13 and over, if a child requests access to our website we accommodate them by offering a limited feature set and restricted website experience that removes certain features. We offer this restricted experience (“Child Account”) for accounts of all users below the age of 13 and for some users below the age of 16 where applicable under local law.</div>
            <div className='context-montserrat'>Balikaral does not accumulate personal information about any Child Account for distribution, sharing, or selling, except as described in this Privacy Notice.

            <div className='context-montserrat'>We do not condition a child's participation or access to any activity on Balikaral on the child providing any personally-identifying information or any more information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.</div>
            <div className='context-montserrat'>We may use aggregated or de-identified information about children for research, analysis, marketing and other commercial purposes.</div>

            <div className='context-montserrat'>Third Party Service Providers</div>
            <div className='context-montserrat'>Where necessary, we use restricted versions of our third-party services (for example, Google Analytics) that limit data sharing and tracking on areas of our site and mobile apps that are accessed by children to support our internal operations.</div>
            
            <div className='context-montserrat'>Parental Rights</div>

Parents can also request that Balikaral delete that information and refuse to allow Balikaral to collect further information from their children by contacting Balikaral at support@quizlet.com. Balikaral may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of a parent or guardian before responding to a request to review or delete a child's information or a request to refuse further collection from a child.</div>
